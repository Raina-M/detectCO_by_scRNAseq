# detectCO_by_scRNAseq
A pipeline of crossover identification based on scRNA-seq data from gametes, also including analysis of recombination results. Specifically, a project about the recombination of a holocentric plant - *R. breviuscula* was taken as the instance to delineate the pipeline.

Please cite the following publication when using our pipeline.
