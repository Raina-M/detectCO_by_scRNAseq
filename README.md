# detectCO_by_scRNAseq
A pipeline of crossover identification based on scRNA-seq data from gametes, also including analysis of recombiantion results. Specifically, a project about the recombination of a holocentric plant - *R. breviuscula* was taken as the instance to delineated the pipeline.

The manuscript about this project is under preparation.
